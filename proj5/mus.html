        <H2 class="heading_style"> Gentle On my Mind</H2>
                    <P> "Gentle on my Mind" Is one of the most played songs of all time. My Mandolin Mentor once told me he origionally wrote it as a joke. He found the decending D-Major Chord Progression was popular in pop music of the age. He wrote lyrics, and called it Gentle On my Mind. Glenn Campbell later recorded the track, and it became a hit, Netting Hartford over $120,000 annually in royalties. The song, with it's yearnful lyrics and strong instrumental backing, has since become a country music standard. It was later recorded by Frank Sinatra, Waylon Jennings, and Elvis Presley. This song, while not my very favorite john hartford song, allowed him to do whatever he wanted artistically, and is one of my favorite songs of all time. </P>

                    <h2 class="heading_style">Austin Minor Sympathy</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Austin Minor Sympathy" is a reflective and emotionally resonant song from John Hartford's 1976 album Mark Twang. The track showcases Hartford's storytelling ability and his talent for weaving vivid, intimate narratives into his music. Unlike many of his more whimsical or light-hearted songs, "Austin Minor Sympathy" carries a more melancholic tone, reflecting on themes of longing, nostalgia, and personal growth. The song's instrumentation is simple yet evocative, primarily driven by Hartford's masterful fiddle playing. The song exemplifies Hartford's ability to balance musical innovation with heartfelt emotion, using traditional bluegrass instruments and structures to create something deeply personal and timeless. "Austin Minor Sympathy" stands out as one of his more contemplative works, capturing the depth of his artistry.</p>
