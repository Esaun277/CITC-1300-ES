     <h2 class="heading_style">Hartford's Life</h2>
        <P>John Hartford (1937–2001) was an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and steamboat pilot, best known for his contributions to folk, bluegrass, and country music. Born in New York City but raised in St. Louis, Hartford developed a passion for riverboats and traditional American music, which would deeply influence his work. His breakthrough came in 1967 when his song "Gentle on My Mind" became a massive hit, recorded by Glen Campbell and hundreds of other artists. The success allowed him the creative freedom to explore eclectic musical avenues, blending bluegrass, folk, and old-time music with his own whimsical lyrics and experimental sounds. </P></section> </div>
