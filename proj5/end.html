       <section> <h2 class="heading_style">Electric lady origins</h2>
        <P>Electric Lady Studios was founded in 1970 by legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who envisioned a space where artists could explore their creativity freely. Hendrix had originally purchased a nightclub in Greenwich Village, New York, with plans to turn it into a live performance venue, but he later shifted his vision to build a state-of-the-art recording studio. He wanted a place where he and other musicians could experiment with sound and push the boundaries of music production. Partnering with architect and acoustician John Storyk, they designed the studio to offer an inviting, vibrant atmosphere, breaking away from the sterile environments of most recording spaces at the time. Tragically, Hendrix passed away just weeks after the studio opened, but Electric Lady went on to become one of the most iconic studios in music history, attracting a diverse array of artists across generations.        </P></section>

                    <p>Over the years, it became a creative hub for a wide range of artists, including notable women who pushed boundaries in their respective genres. These artists include Patti Smith, who brought a fusion of punk rock and poetry, and Beyoncé, who recorded part of her acclaimed album Lemonade at the studio. St. Vincent, too, utilized the space to craft her avant-garde sound. These women, among others, are celebrated for their innovation, influence, and willingness to challenge norms, embodying a spirit of creativity that mirrors the studio's legendary reputation.</p></aside>
